"""Basic feature extraction for audio segments.

This module provides baseline MFCC feature extraction functionality:
1. MFCC computation with configurable coefficients
2. Delta (first derivative) features
3. Segment-level feature aggregation (means)

For richer feature sets, see rich_features.py which provides additional 
time-domain and spectral descriptors at multiple complexity levels.
